fake-infer – AI Service Reliability Lab

A miniature but complete SRE playground:

FastAPI “model-inference” service instrumented with Prometheus

k3d single-node Kubernetes cluster for local spin-up

kube-prometheus-stack (Prometheus + Alertmanager + Grafana) via Helm

Dashboards, SLOs & alerts wired end-to-end

One-command load script to drill alerts

Why – to practise real-world observability/alerting without cloud costs or a huge laptop.


I didn't finish this project. My main goals were to open and run a docker container + start a kubernetes cluster, both of which were accomplished.
I will practice the alert manager more later.
